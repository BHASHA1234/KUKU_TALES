# --- Specific Handling for 'images' Directory ---
# If your images/ directory *only* contains source assets like 'kukutales_logo.png'
# that you *want* in Git, then the *.png rule above might be too broad.
# In that case, DELETE the '*.png' line above and instead add these lines:
# # Ignore specific generated image files (if they exist)
# generated_book_cover.png
# book_cover.png
# -- OR --
# If your images/ directory ONLY contains generated images you DON'T want in Git,
# uncomment the next line to ignore the whole folder:
# images/

# --- Potentially Unused Files ---
# If 'story_pipeline.py' is an OLD file and NOT part of your current app,
# uncomment the next line to ignore it. Otherwise, leave it commented to track it.
# story_pipeline.py# --- Secrets ---
